# Mock Blog

## Welcome!

In this lab you will create a blog front end with users, and posts pulled from jsonplaceholder.typicode.com containing several different sections:

* On the home page there should be a sidebar with a list of authors
* When an author's name is clicked it should send you to a page with all the posts by that author.
* On the homepage there should be a list of all blog posts, displayed by title
* When a post is clicked it should take you to a dedicated page for that post with the author's name, the title of the post, and the body

> Hint: Create template pages for authors and posts, then use query parameters, or url fragments to determine what data to fetch. This will make it so you don't need 100 very similar pages for each post.
