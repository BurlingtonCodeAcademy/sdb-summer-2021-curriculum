# Hello Frenemy WWW

## Welcome!

In this lab you will set up an input form where you can enter a name, and the page will display text greeting that name.

  - Set up a form with a text input, and submit button
  - When a user inputs their name and hits submit; the page displays a personalized greeting for that name
  -  Format the name so that it's always capitalized
  - Bonus Challenge: Can you get it to say hello to some names, and tell others to go away?

## Creating the Page

Setting up an html doc, and separate JS file

## Linking JavaScript

talking about the script tag and src attribute

## Reading Properties

Looking at HTML elements in JS

## Forms as Input

Setting up a form element with one text input, and a submit button

## The `<input>` Element

Talking about inputs, and values. Stress that inputs can never have children

## Submit Events

prevent them. We don't want the page refreshing

There are two properties that effect the submit event, the method and the action. We'll talk about those later

## Writing to the DOM

We'll want the names displaying on the page, just put it in the display for now.

## Clearing the Form

## Modal Dialog Boxes

Display areas are boring. Let's turn it into a modal!

Styling modals, tracking state.

## Enemy Alert!

Just telling our enemies to go away is boring. Let's make a flashing alert modal
