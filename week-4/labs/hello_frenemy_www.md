# Lab: Say Hello

In this lab you will set up an input form where you can enter a name, and the page will display text greeting that name.

  - Set up a form with a text input, and submit button
  - When a user inputs their name and hits submit the page displays a personalized greeting for that name
  -  Format the name so that it's always capitalized
  - Bonus Challenge: Can you get it to say hello to some names, and tell others to go away?
