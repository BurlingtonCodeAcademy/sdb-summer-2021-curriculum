# Hello Frenemy WWW

## Welcome!

In this lab you will set up an input form where you can enter a name, and the page will greet that name with a fancy popup. We'll also make it so that if an enemy is entered it will alert us of that, and deny them entry

## Creating the Page

Setting up an html doc, and separate JS file

Link them with a script tag

## Reading Properties

Looking at HTML elements in JS is fairly easy. Use a dom query. Access the properties as if the html element was an object (because it more or less is)

## Forms as Input

Setting up a form element with one text input, and a submit button

## The `<input>` Element

Talking about inputs, and values. Stress that inputs can never have child nodes, only values

## Submit Events

prevent them. We don't want the page refreshing

There are two properties that effect the submit event, the `method` and the `action`. We'll talk about those later in the course when we look at the server side of things.

## Writing to the DOM

We'll want the names displaying on the page, just put it in the display for now.

## Clearing the Form

Just set the input's value to an empty string

## Modal Dialog Boxes

Display areas are boring. Let's turn it into a modal!

Styling modals, tracking state.

## Enemy Alert!

Just telling our enemies to go away is boring. Let's make a flashing alert modal
