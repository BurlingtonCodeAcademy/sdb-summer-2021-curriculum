# Reading Forms on the Server

## Welcome!

## Creating the Front end

with React

It's going to need a form

## Setting up the Server

Basic express setup

add `express.urlencoded()` middleware to parse request bodies

## POST vs GET

set up an express route to handle POST requests to whatever the path is

Make sure the form on the front end has a `method="POST"` and `action="/whateverpath"`

## View the Request Body
