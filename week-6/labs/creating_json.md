# Lab: Creating a JSON file

JSON files are easy to create since they are just JS objects, that only contain strings. When creating JSON objects **keep in mind** that the keys need to be double quoted.

Let's go ahead and create a JSON file now.

* create a new directory named `json-server`
* inside this directory create a subdirectory called `api`
* inside `api` create a file named `example.json`
* In `example.json` create a JSON object containing:
  * a name
  * a quest
  * a favorite color
