This is MongoDb's GUI tool. Let's open it up and see what it can do!

- Open Compass and click on the green "Connect" button; it defaults to `localhost` for ease of use.

- Look for the database named `test**` in the left side nav bar, and open it
- Create a new collection
- In the collection you just created try running through all the CRUD functions
  - Add some documents, update them, delete them...

** `test` is a default database name provided by MongoDB.
