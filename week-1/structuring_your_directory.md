# Using the Command Line

## Welcome!

The purpose of this lab is to help you get  little more comfortable interacting with your computer through the command line. The command line (a.k.a. shell, terminal, etc.) will be our primary way of interacting with our programs throughout this course so it's important we get comfortable using it.

In this lab you will set up the basic directory structure you will use to keep your code organized throughout this class, and you will write, and run a JavaScript program on your local computer.
