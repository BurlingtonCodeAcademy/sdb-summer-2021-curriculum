# Data!

Manipulating data is a lot like preparing food.

We start out with ingredients and use tools to reshape them into something new one step at a time.

# Objectives

- Syntax basics
  - Simple values and types
  - Operators
  - Expressions
  - Statements

Prioritize _understanding concepts_, knowing _where to looks things up_, _testing out your ideas_, and _noting the results of those tests_.

## Do _not_ try to memorize everything.

---

# Values

- A _value_ is a piece of information or _data_.
- There are seven _types_ of _data_ in JavaScript.
- Different _data types_ have different advantages and disadvantages.
- We use _data_ to represent stuff from the real world often:
  - a list of students
  - the temperature throughout the day

---

# Simple Data Types Overview

- Numbers
- Strings
- Booleans
- Null and Undefined
- Special values
- Not discussed here:
  - BigInt
  - Symbol
- More complex data formats will be discussed later.

# _What_ are Numbers

A **number** is what it sounds like -- any integer or decimal.

- `10`
- `-12`
- `3.14`

---

# _When_ and _Why_ to Use Numbers

We can use numbers to help solve many problems:

- Tracking amounts and counts
- Answering yes or no questions
- Bookmarking a place in a list
- Simulating movement in a direction

---

# _What_ are Strings

A **string** is a collection of _characters_, like a word or a sentence.

```js
"apple"
"Cherry Pie"
"&%$!"
"1234"
"    "
```

---

# _When_ and _Why_ to Use Strings

Strings are used to help solve problems like these:

- Storing names of people or items
- Storing locations and addresses
- Acting as very simple lists
- Splitting sets of characters at specific points
  - e.g. Separating first and last names, removing the $ from prices, etc.

---

# Strings Have Indexes

String indexes start at 0, and not 1, like some would expect.

Think of the indexes as pointing at the *spaces between* characters, as in this diagram:

```
| B | L | U | E | B | E | R | R | Y |
0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
```

So with this picture in your mind

```js
"blueberry".slice(0, 4)
```
  
What portion of the word would you get back?

---

# _What_ are Booleans

A **boolean** is a value that is either true or false, and is represented in JavaScript with the keywords `true`, and `false`.

- Many operations return booleans and are used to run code conditionally (more on that later)

- Pretty much any data in JavaScript can be evaluated as a boolean

- often we use implicit truthy, or falsy values instead of the actual keywords `true` and `false`

(It's named after _[George Boole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole)_,
a 19th-century mathematician who invented [Boolean algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra).)

---

# _When_ and _Why_ to Use Booleans

Booleans are often used to solve these sorts of problems:

- Answering yes/no questions
  - e.g. If this is true/false, then...
- Turning features on and off
  - e.g. Showing the mobile menu icon or hiding it
- Starting and stopping processes
  - We'll discuss this _When_ covering loops

---

# Null and Undefined

- **null** means "nothing" or "no"
- **undefined** means "never has been" or "does not exist"

- These are often used to detect the presence or absence of data.

---

# Special Values

Sometimes the return value is a special value!

```js
5 / 0; // return value: Infinity
"cookie" * 10; // return value: NaN, Not A Number
```

---

# _How_ to Use Values

We can combine, manipulate, and reference values to write programs using these tools:

- Operators
- Expressions
- Statements
- Functions

---

# _What_ are Operators

Values can be combined, split up, or changed using **operators**.

- PLUS (`+`)
- TIMES (`*`)
- POWER (`**`)
- DOT (`.`)
- ASSIGNMENT (`=`)
- COMPARISON (`===`, )

An operator _sends a message_ to the value after it:

- `1 + 2` sends the number `1` the message `please add 2 to yourself.`

---

# _When_ and _Why_ to Use Operators

Like data there are several different _types_ of operators that are used in different circumstances.

- Assignment
- Comparison
- Arithmetic
- Logical
- Conditional
- And more advanced ones not discussed here

[MDN | Expressions and Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators)

---

# Expressions

**Expressions** are unprocessed values that can be grouped together using `( )`.

The computer **evaluates** _expressions_ to create the **return value** -- the value _returned_ to you at the end of the _evaluation_ process.

Note: Empty `()` is an _expression_ with no defined value. You'll see a lot of these empty _expressions_ throughout the course and your career.

---

# Expression Examples

We can use Node in the terminal to see the _return values_ of these expressions.

- `2 + 2`
- `'five' + 'five'`
- `( 1 < 2 )`
- `( true === false )`
- `( 'here' !== 'there' )`
- `( (1 < 2) && (2 < 3) )`

---

# Statements

**Statements** are key words, expressions, and code blocks combined.

We use them to tell the computer more information about what our expressions are meant to do.

They generally take on this format, but there are exceptions we cover later:

```js
keyword name (expression) { code block }
```

Note: We cannot use _variables_ to save statements for later. Why? What could we use instead?

[Mozilla Developer Network | Statement and Declarations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements)

---

# Statements Examples

```js
break; // key word

doSomething(); // Variables and function names act as key words once defined

let someVariable = 'some value';

if (true) {
  console.log('show me something in the terminal');
}

for (let i = 1; i < 2; i++) {
  console.log('For Loops use 3 expressions separated by ;s in their structure');
}

function doSomething() {
  console.log('Functions do things.');
}
```
