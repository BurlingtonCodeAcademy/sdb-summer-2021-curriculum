# Playing With Numbers

## Welcome!

Numbers are one of the 6 JavaScript primitive types, and are very useful in programming. In general computers understand, and deal with numbers much more cleanly than the do words because to a computer *everything* is represented as numbers.

## Watch Out for the Holes!

In JavaScript there is only one data type for all numbers. Because there is only a limited amount of room to store an infinite amount of combinations there are a few holes in JavaScript's number system. Try the following operations, and see what you get:

- `0.1 + 0.2`
- `2**53 === 2**53 + 1`
- `(0.8 - 0.7 - 0.1)/(0.5 - 0.4 - 0.1)`
- `0.5 - 0.4 - 0.1`
- `2**10000`

## Arithmetic Operators

In JavaScript we've got all the usual suspects for arithmetic operators:

- addition `+`
- subtraction `-`
- multiplication `*`
- division `/`
- modulus`%`
- exponent `**`

Go ahead and try and use each of these in an operation.

- Were the results what you expected?
- Can we build more complex operations using multiple operators?
- Does JavaScript follow order of operations (PEMDAS)?
