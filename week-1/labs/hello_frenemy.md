# Hello Friend, Go Away Enemy

## Welcome!

The goal of this lab is to write a program that will accept a name as input from the user through the command line. If the name is one of a pre-determined list of enemies the program should tell the enemy to go away, otherwise it should greet the person by name, and ask for another name, until an enemy name is entered or the user says their name is "bye!"

## Core Concepts:

### Input/Output

### Conditionals

### Loops

## Greet a Single Name

## Speak Friend, and Enter

## When in Doubt `console.log` it Out

## Repeat Until Complete

## Try it Out
