# Capitalize

## Welcome!

In this lab we will be writing a function that takes a string as an argument, and returns a capitalized version of that string.

But before we dig into the lab, let's talk a little bit about strings and functions.

## Strings

Strings are one of the six primitive data types in JavaScript. Take a moment to look back at the "Playing With Strings" lab, and refamiliarize yourself with some of the basic concepts of strings.

Remember:

- You can access individual characters in a string by their *index number*
- Strings have many methods available to them. If you need part of a string you can use the `.slice` method
- Strings are *immutable* so any operation that changes a string will return a **new** string, not modify the existing string.

## Functions

Functions are a way of *encapsulating* sections of code. Calling a function will run the code that is written in the body of the function's definition.
