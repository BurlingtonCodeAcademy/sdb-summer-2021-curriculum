# Project Planning, pre-Agile

* Waterfall 
  * NASA-style
* Auteurism
  * "It's done when it's done"
* Death March
  * Fixed scope, fixed time, fixed cost => 
  * low quality of code
  * low quality of life
* the Mythical Man-Month 
  * adding more people to a late project makes it more late

# Software Development, pre-Agile

* start coding before you understand the problem
* keep coding until it seems to work
* move on to the next problem
* work alone
* wait for QA to find bugs
* react defensively to feedback and bug reports

# The Agile Manifesto

<http://agilemanifesto.org/>

```
We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.
```

# Manifesto Principles

<http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html>

# Beware of Dark Agile

aka Faux Agile or Evil Agile

<https://ronjeffries.com/articles/018-01ff/abandon-1/>

this obeys Chaffee's Law of Titles: if a discipline's title includes a complimentary descriptor, then that descriptor does not apply

  * Computer Science is not a science
  * Agile is not agile

# Agile Methodologies

* Extreme Programming (XP)
* Scrum
* Kanban
* SAFE
* ...and several others

# Extreme Programming (XP)

Why is it called "extreme"? Mostly it's tongue-in-cheek, but beneath that is an honest experiment:

> Instead of saying "we should really do X..." <br>
> (and then not)<br>
> ...what if we do X **all the time** ?

(where X is testing, code review, incremental design, refactoring, ...)

# XP values

* Communication
* Feedback
* Simplicity
* Courage

# XP Practices

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming_practices>

# XP Practices: Fine scale feedback
* Pair programming
* Planning game
* Release planning
* Iteration planning
* Test driven development

# XP Practices: Whole team
* War Room
* Continuous integration
* Design improvement (refactoring, domain modeling)
* Small releases

# XP Practices: Shared understanding
* Coding standard
* Collective code ownership
* Simple design
* Inceptions
* Clear written acceptance criteria
* Automated acceptance tests
* User-centric design (e.g. personas)

# XP Practices:	Programmer welfare
* Sustainable pace
* Continuous process improvement (via retrospectives)

# XP Practices: Iterative development
* Time boxed iterations
* work, measure, plan, repeat

# Yesterday's Weather

The most efficient way to answer the question,

> "What will today's weather be?"

is with the question,

> "What was the weather yesterday?"

...sure it'll be wrong 20% of the time, but that's a **much** better rate than every other planning system 

# Continuous Improvement

First learn the rules

then obey the rules

then improve the rules

(then repeat)

# Retrospectives

see [cadence](./cadence) and [retrospectives](./retrospectives) lessons
