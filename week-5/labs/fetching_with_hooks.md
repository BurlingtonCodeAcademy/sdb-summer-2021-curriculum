# React Router Blog

Let's create a fake blog using [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) and React Router!

* When the user visits the homepage they should see a welcome page with:
  * a greeting ('Welcome to our page, click an article to get started')
  * a list of all available articles from JSONPlaceholder by title
* When the user clicks an article's title it should take you to a new page with:
  * the contents of that article
  * the title
  * the author's name
  * and when you click the author's name it should take you to a page with a list of all the articles **by that author**
