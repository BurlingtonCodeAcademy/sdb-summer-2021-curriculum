# Lab: Post Selector

Let's create a React component that consists of two main components; a list of posts, and a display box. These should be two seperate components. You will also need a parent component that renders both the list, and the display box.

Using state and props set up the page so that when you click on a post the cotent is rendered in the display box.

> Hint: If you want to store your posts locally it might be easiest to create JSON files to represent the posts. Or you could just use [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
