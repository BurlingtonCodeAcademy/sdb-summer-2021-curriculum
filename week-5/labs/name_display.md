# Lab: Name Display

In order to get more comfortable with `useState` we are going to create a functional React component that has a form with two input fields for a first name, and last name. When the form is submitted we will display the full name on the page.

- Create a new React App
- Modify `App.js` so it only contains a form with two inputs with a type of `text`, and a display area
- Using `useState` create three variables to keep track of:
  - the first name
  - the last name
  - the full name

- When the form is submitted display the full name on the page
- This **must be** a functional React component
