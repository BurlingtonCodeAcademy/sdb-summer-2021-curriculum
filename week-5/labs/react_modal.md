# Modal Display

Let's create a simple modal popup using the power of conditional rendering!  Modal boxes are used all over the web, and are essentially a popup display. You see them quite often with image galleries where you can click a preview thumbnail, and the full size image opens as a popup.

- Create a new react project
- It should have a button that says "Click me"
- When this button is pressed a box should open *on top of* the existing page
- And it should say "Hello! I am a modal!"
- And have a "close" button
- When the "close" button is clicked the modal should go away
