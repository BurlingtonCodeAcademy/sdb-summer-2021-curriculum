# A responsive nav bar in react using React Router


# Lab: React Nav Bar

Let's set up a simple site with some basic navigation using React Router.

- Create a new react app
- Create an `About` Component, a `Homepage` component, and a `Nav` component
- add links to the `Nav` component that direct you to the `Home` and `About` pages
- The `Nav` component should be loaded on both the `Home`, and `About` pages
