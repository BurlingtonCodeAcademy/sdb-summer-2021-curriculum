# Responsive Layout

* "Responsive" means that the layout *changes* and responds based on the width of the screen
* This allows for specific layouts for mobile phones, tablets, screen readers, and more
* Layouts can be redered conditionally based on:
    * Screen size
    * Pixel density
    * Screen orientation
    * Height/Width Ratio i.e. 11:9

Why might this be important?

# What is Responsive Development?

* Responsive development is a technique that displays content well regardless of the device it is being viewed on
* This concept is increasingly important, not all users are desktop browsers
* In 2017 and 2018 more than 50% of web traffic was from mobile devices

# Responsive Layout: Media Queries

* CSS3 introduced media queries, which allow developers to apply CSS properties to devices which match rules
* Media queries are the backbone of front-end responsive development with HTML and CSS
* Applying CSS to specific screen widths allows for changing the layout and styles based on the size of a device

# Using Media Queries

* Media Queries (`@media (some_condition) { }`) cause different CSS rules to be applied on different screens


#### Example

This will make our `.nav` element position relative when the media type is `print`

```css

// Default position layout

.nav {
  position: absolute;
}

// Print media only layout

@media print {
  .nav {
    position: relative;
  }
}
```

# Media Features

Each feature is a characteristic of the **user-agent**

| Query       | Description                                              |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| width       | the width of the viewport                                |
| all         | TRUE if the device responds to media queries             |
| resolution  | Pixel density of the output device                       |
| color       | Number of bits per color component of the device         |
| pointer     | Is the primary input mechanism a pointing device         |
| hover       | Does the primary input mechanism allow the user to hover |

# Media Query Conditionals - AND

Only change the layout to `position: relative;` when

  * The media is `screen`
  * AND
  * The screen width is greater than or equal to 768 pixels

```css

@media screen and (min-width:768px) {
  .nav {
    position: relative;
  }
}
```

---

# Media Query Conditionals - OR

NOTE: OR is the `,` (comma) in a Media Query

Only change the layout to `position: relative;` when

  * The media is `screen`
  * OR
  * The screen width is greater than or equal to 768 pixels

```css

@media screen, (min-width:768px) {
  .nav {
    position: relative;
  }
}
```

# Mobile-First Development

* Developing mobile first means to start styling out your web page for a mobile device, and then modify the layout for a desktop browser
* The result of this is modifying your CSS as screen sizes increase, rather than modifying your CSS as screen sizes decrease
* In other words, your media queries will be written for minimum widths, not maximum widths
* Tip: You can also set media queries in-between two screen sizes
