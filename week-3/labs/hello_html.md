# Hello HTML!

## Welcome!

In this lab we will be building out a website using basic CSS, and HTML. Ultimately we want it to have the same basic layout of this rough wireframe

![Hello HTML Wireframe]()

Create a file named `index.html`. The name `index.html` is actually significant, and your homepage should **always** be named `index.html`.

## Using Emmet Abbreviations

## Let's Add Content!

We will now add some text to our first web page! Inside of the `<body>` tag, let's add the following text:

```
Hello, world!
```

So it looks like this:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    Hello, world!
  </body>
</html>
```

## Use a VSCode Extension to View the Page

There are several plugins for VSCode designed to help you serve static webfiles. Let's use one to make viewing our webpage a little easier.

* Go ahead and click the "Extensions" (or press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + X)
* Search for 'Live Server' and install the extension of that name developed by Ritwick Dey.
* Close and reopen VSCode.
* You should now have a button in the lower right corner of VSCode that says 'go live'
* Click it to launch your site (locally at least)

## Inspect The File With Chrome

* In your browser, open the "Developer Tools" window
  * On Mac - `âŒ˜ + Shift + C`
  * On Windows / Linux - `Ctrl + Shift + C` or `F12`
  * Or: *right click* on the page and select 'inspect'
* If it isn't clear, find and click on the elements tab
* Notice how the HTML tags are displayed
* You can do this for **any website** to examine how it is structured
  * or to change its colors, or remove ads, or...?
