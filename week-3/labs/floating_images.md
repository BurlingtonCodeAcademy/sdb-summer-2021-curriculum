# Image Wrapping

In a new subdirectory create a new `index.html` file

* Add a `style` tag at the top of the html document's `body` section
* Add container `div`s for each image, and give them a `class` name.
* In each container, on the same level as the image, add a `p` tag with some text in it
* Using the style tag write some CSS to wrap the text around the images.
