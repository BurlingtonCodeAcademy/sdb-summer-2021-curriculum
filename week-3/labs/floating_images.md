# Objective

## Learning

In this lab, we will put what we have learned about the CSS float property to practice. We will also again use CSS properties and selectors.

Topics:

- Utilizing a given wire frame.
- CSS styling.
- CSS properties and selectors.
- CSS float.

## Achieving

In this lab, we will utilize a given wire frame to style our website with CSS according to its guidelines.

Your work will result in:

- A website that closely matches the given wire frame.

# Procedure

## Linking `styles.css` to `index.html`
- [ ] Inside of `index.html`, you will need to link your stylesheet.
- [ ] You will find information on how to do this at the following link: [Freecodecamp's How to Link CSS to HTML](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/external-css-stylesheets-how-to-link-css-to-html-and-import-into-head/).
- [ ] In the `src` attribute for the link, you will need to route your link through the `styles` subfolder to reach `styles.css`.

## Opening the wireframe

- [ ] Click the following link to open the wire frame: [Figma Wire Frame](https://www.figma.com/file/X3A44p0vurtx0IYdIWoD6U/floating-images?node-id=0%3A1).
- [ ] **Note:** This wireframe is not "pixel perfect" so don't stress having it match dimensions exactly. We are looking to capture the spirit of the wireframe.

## Understanding the wireframe

- [ ] This wireframe has similar areas to the one you used during the Hello Styles lab.
- [ ] `<header>` matches ARTICLE TITLE.
- [ ] The two white boxes with black diagonal lines are images.
- [ ]  `<section>` corresponds to FLOATING TEXT.

## Styling the divs

- [ ] You will need to again utilize CSS properties and CSS selectors in order to style this website.
- [ ] You will also need to utilize the CSS float property in order to acheive the text wrapping around the image.
- [ ] As a reminder, here are a few options for placeholder images: [Lorem Flickr](https://loremflickr.com/), [Placekitten](https://placekitten.com/). [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/)

# Review

In this lab, we have translated a wireframe to a website utilizing CSS.

The software should:

- Be a styled website whose design matches that presented in the wireframe.

## Going Further

- Customize the colors on the website.
- Import fonts and utilize them.
- Create more pages that utilize the float property for text and images.
