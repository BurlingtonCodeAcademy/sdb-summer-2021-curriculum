# Shift It Around

Remember our old friend example-html? Let's bring it back for one final lab.

Here we have a page that is starting to look somewhat decent, but what happens when you squish the screen down?

In this lab we are going to make the `index.html` page look good at any size. Feel free to use flexbox, and/or grid while you complete the following tasks for mobile view (screen width < 450px)

* Lay your nav bar out vertically
* Don't wrap the text around the images
* Decrease the space between elements
* Resize the images, and iframes so they fit the page.
* Remove the background image, or use a different (smaller) background image
