# Image Gallery

## Objective

### Learning

In this lab, we will put what we have learned about the CSS grid layout to use. We will also begin to practice with responsive units of measurement and responsive design. This will also require the continued practice of styling with CSS and referencing another wireframe. 

Topics:

- Utilizing a given wire frame.
- CSS styling.
- CSS grid layout.
- Responsive CSS units of measurement & responsive design.

### Achieving

In this lab, we will utilize a given wire frame to style our website with CSS according to its guidelines. We will also need to utilize responsive units of measurement in order for our website to scale correctly no matter the height and width of the browser window.

Your work will result in:

- A website that closely matches the given wire frame.

## Procedure

### Creating the `image-gallery` directory and `index.html`

- [ ] Create a directory named `image-gallery` and `cd` into it.
- [ ] Create a file named `index.html`via `touch`.

### Creating the `styles` subdirectory and `styles.css`
- [ ] Inside of `image-gallery`, create a new directory named `styles`.
- [ ] Inside of `styles`, create a new filed named `styles.css`
- [ ] `styles.css` is where all of your CSS will be written.

### Linking `styles.css` to `index.html`
- [ ] Inside of `index.html`, you will need to link your stylesheet.
- [ ] You will find information on how to do this at the following link: [Freecodecamp's How to Link CSS to HTML](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/external-css-stylesheets-how-to-link-css-to-html-and-import-into-head/).
- [ ] In the `src` attribute for the link, you will need to route your link through the `styles` subfolder to reach `styles.css`.

### Opening the wireframe

- [ ] Click the following link to open the wire frame: [Figma Wire Frame](https://www.figma.com/file/4aMSQ25zzEVDr3l3yq1FVc/image-gallery?node-id=0%3A1).
- [ ] **Note:** This wireframe is not "pixel perfect" so don't stress having it match dimensions exactly. We are looking to capture the spirit of the wireframe.

### Understanding the wireframe

- [ ] This wireframe has similar areas to the one you used during the Hello Styles lab.
- [ ] `<header>` matches IMAGE GALLERY NAME.
- [ ] `<nav>` matches the LINK areas that contain four links.
- [ ] The large image placeholder (the white box with diagonal lines) is your hero image. 'Hero' is a design term for an over sized banner or image that is prominent on a page.
- [ ] The six smaller image placeholders represent the gallery on the page.
- [ ]  `<footer>` corresponds to FOOTER SITE INFORMATION.

### Styling the divs

- [ ] You will need to again utilize CSS properties and CSS selectors in order to style this website.
- [ ] You will also need to utilize the CSS grid layout model to keep your hero image and your gallery images centered and aligned.
- [ ] In order for your website to be responsive, you will have to utilize responsive units instead of `px`. Some you can research and play with are: `rem`, `em`, `vw`, `vh`, and `%`s.
- [ ] As a reminder, here are a few options for placeholder images: [Lorem Flickr](https://loremflickr.com/), [Placekitten](https://placekitten.com/). [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/)

## Review

In this lab, we have translated a wireframe to a website utilizing CSS.

The software should:

- Be a styled website whose design matches that presented in the wireframe.

## Going Further

- Customize the colors on the website.
- Import fonts and utilize them.
- Use CSS grid to layout the links in the `<nav>`.
