## Objective

Understand how to use Flexbox and other CSS to create a common page layout.

## Learning

In this lab, we will put what we have learned about the CSS flexbox layout to use. We will also continue to practice with responsive units of measurement and responsive design. This will also require the continued practice of styling with CSS and referencing another wire frame. 

Topics:

- Utilizing a given wire frame.
- CSS styling.
- CSS flexbox layout.
- Responsive CSS units of measurement & responsive design.

## Achieving

In this lab, we will utilize a given wire frame to style our website with CSS according to its guidelines. We will also need to utilize responsive units of measurement in order for our website to scale correctly no matter the height and width of the browser window.

Your work will result in:

- A website that closely matches the given wire frame.

## Procedure

### Setting up the file infrastructure and linking `styles.css` to `index.html`

- [ ] Create a directory named `article-preview` with `index.html` within it.
- [ ] Within `article-preview`, create another directory named `styles`.
- [ ] Within `styles`, create a `styles.css` file.
- [ ] Link `styles.css` to `index.html`.

### Opening and referencing the wireframe

- [ ] Click the following link to open the wire frame: [Figma Wire Frame](https://www.figma.com/file/QqmQF04L6BbTsJCE88ePxn/article-preview?node-id=0%3A1).
- [ ] **Note:** This wireframe is not "pixel perfect" so don't stress having it match dimensions exactly. We are looking to capture the spirit of the wireframe.
- [ ] As described in [Hello HTML](https://online.uprighted.com/lessons/written/hello-html) and [Hello Styles](https://online.uprighted.com/lessons/written/hello-styles), this wireframe maps to semantic divs you need to create. See if you can understand the wireframe without referencing the explicit instructions in the previous labs. 

### Styling the divs

- [ ] CSS selectors and CSS properties will again be utilized.
- [ ] Responsive units of measurement will need to be utilized: `rem`, `em`, `vw`, `vh`, `%`s.
- [ ] You will need to utilize the CSS flexbox layout model in order to achieve the wireframe.
- [ ] As a reminder, here are a few options for placeholder images: [Lorem Flickr](https://loremflickr.com/), [Placekitten](https://placekitten.com/). [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/)

## Review

In this lab, we have translated a wireframe to a website utilizing CSS.

The software should:

- Be a styled website whose design matches that presented in the wireframe.

## Going Further

- Customize the colors on the website.
- Import fonts and utilize them.
- Utilize pseudoselectors such as `:hover`.
- In the nav bar, have a link named 'Support' that leads to a new page. Utilize this bonus wireframe: [Figma Wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/BaFklBCZl0FUSou3kKK3OG/article-preview-bonus?node-id=0%3A1) to style it.
