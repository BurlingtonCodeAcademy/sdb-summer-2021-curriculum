# Fibonacci Stack

## Welcome!

In this lab we will be building out a program that prints out the first 10 numbers in the fibonacci sequence `0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34` using an array as a stack. Create a new file called `fib.js`

The fibonacci sequence is the result of adding the first two numbers to generate the third. 0 + 1 = 1; 1 + 1 = 2; 1 + 2 = 3; 2 + 3 = 5; 3 + 5 = 6; and so on, and so forth until infinity.

## Initialize Your Array

```js
let series = [0, 1];
```

## Create the function


```js
function fibonacci() {
  
}
```

## Repeat Until Complete

## Printing the Values
