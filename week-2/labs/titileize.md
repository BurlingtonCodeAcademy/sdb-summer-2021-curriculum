# Titleize

## Welcome!

In this lab we will be creating a function that takes a multi-word string, and capitalizes the first letter of each word, while making sure the rest of each word is lowercase. To do this we will be utilizing the awesome power of arrays, and the ease with which we can convert strings to arrays, and back again.

Create a new file called `titleize.js`
